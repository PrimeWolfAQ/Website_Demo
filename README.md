# RDT_Demo

Demo website. Scrapping the old nyu.rdt.engineering.edu thing.

# Running Hugo <br/>
To run (assume you noobs run Window), install Chocolatey and then Hugo. <br/>
On Powershell or Command Line, cd to the directory and run >> hugo server <br/>
Then use your favorite browser (not Chrome) and open localhost:1313 <br/>

# Customizing <br/>

config.toml in the root directory and homepage.yaml in the /data directory <br/>
is where all the text and images are in. Change text around or put new image in. <br/>
Hugo will automatically reload the page for you.

# How to add a page

Add page in config.toml (in root directory). Then create a markdown (.md) file in the content directory. This will add a new page to the website and will show up in the directory.
